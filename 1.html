  <p>
    Put a dead cat on the railroad tracks
  <br>And get the eyeball of a rooster
  <br>And the stones from a ditch
  <br>And wash em down with bilge water
  <br>And say you'll never snitch
  <br>Take the buttons from a yellow jacket
   </P>
   <p>
  The feather from a buzzard
  <br>And the blood from the bounty hunters cold black heart
  <br>Catch the tears of a window
  <br>In a thimble made of glass
  <br>Tell your mama and your papa
  <br>They can kiss your ass
  </p><p>
  Poison all the water in the wishin' well
  <br>And hang all them scarecrows from a sycamore tree
  <br>Burn down all those honeymoons
  <br>Put em in a pillow case
  <br>And wait next to the switch blades at the amusements park for me
  </p>
  <p>Strangle all the Christmas carols
  <br>Scratch out all you prayers
  <br>Tie em up with barbed wire
  <br>And push them down the stairs
  <br>And I'll whittle you a pistol
  <br>For reepin' nightmares off the blinds
  <br>Those sunsabitches always seem to sneak up from behind </p>
  <p>
  Syphon all the gas from your daddy's pickup truck
  <br>Fill up Johnny's t bird
  <br>I got a couple bucks
  <br>Put on little perfume and ribbon in your hair
  <br>Careful that you don't wake up the hounds </p>
  <p>Tear a bolt of lightning
  <br>Off the side of the sky
  <br>And throw in the cedar chest
  <br>If you want me to tell you why
  <br>Bring the gear shift knob from a forty nine mere
  <br>And lay down here beside me
  <br>Let me hold you in the dirt </p>
  <p>And you'll tremble as the flames
  <br>Tear the throat out of the night
  <br>Sink your teeth into my shoulder
  <br>Dig your nails into my back
  <br>Tell that little girl to let go of my sleeve
  <br>You'll be a woman when I catch you
  <br>As you fall in love with me</p>

  <p>Then with my double barrel shotgun
  <br>And a whole box of shells
  <br>We'll celebrate the fourth of July
  <br>We'll do a hundred mph
  <br>Spendin' someone else's dough
  <br>And we'll drive all the way to Reno
  <br>On the wrong side of the road</p>
  <p> wrong side of the road</p>
